Welcome. This is Echo Future Truth, by D.P. Maddalena. I'm David, and I'm glad your listening. 

If you're the kind of person that believes in a creator, then you may also believe that we are created to be *creative*. Made to make stuff, built to build, etc., and that this gift of creativity is meant to redound to the generosity of the one who made us. And yet, let's be honest: while we are spectacularly creative creatures, often our creations have more to say about our small fears, lusts, and greed than offering any good word about the meaning of life. *Echo Future Truth* considers the question of meaning from the perspective of a single, final, monumental creative work of humankind, designed to serve the last human being, whose own creative power will have to be unleashed for any of it to matter in the end. 

*Echo Future Truth* is a three-part literary science fiction novel exploring isolation and psycho-spiritual resilience at the imagined end of human history. In Book One, *Abrasion*, a single woman, the last human being, faces off against a confounding culture of comforting machines millennia from now, desperately pursuing any remnant of authentic connection that might have survived in the system that defines her life. Book Two, *Isolation*, is set in our present time and follows an old ally of the protagonist of *Abrasion*, but separated from her by thousands of miles and, finally, thousands of years; he also is isolated from the rest of humanity and must battle his way back, only in his case the exile is self-imposed and the obstacles are of his own making. In the final act, *Resistance*, we follow the present-day technologists who scramble to understand (and encode) human need and human provision before abandoning the last human being to her fate. 

*Echo Future Truth* is many things: a sometimes pre-, sometimes post-modern exploration of a very modern problem; a reluctant and unsexy cyberpunk epic; an intentionally mythopoetic love story; and, (let the reader understand) an apocalyptic A.I. salvation story at the end — and the beginning — of the world.
