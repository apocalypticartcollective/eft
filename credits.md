*Echo Future Truth* is written by D.P. Maddalena and is published here for the first time in association with [Apocalyptic Art Collective](apocalypticartcollective.com), a loose association of artists committed to the mutual support of revelatory art generated out of life lived steeped in culture and work. 

## Field Trip Buddies

This work has been made possible with the technical support of Bruce Charonnat (editing, design, promotion, and vision); Nik Bartunek (engineering and marketing); Julie Maddalena (voice coaching and engineering); Marge Boots (graphics); Marilyn Mcentyre (editing); Zoe Maddalena (vibe) and Michael Toy (soul brother, believer, original critic of choice). I'm super grateful for the epic support of early readers and vision partners Eric Mathis; Kevin Marks; Russ Sampson; Carla Mathis; Mike McKenna; Timothy Maddalena. A special thanks to my beautiful, skeptical, supporting wife, Anghelika ('that's kind of your thing') Maddalena.
