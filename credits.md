*Echo Future Truth* was written by D.P. Maddalena between 2015 and 2022, and is published here for the first time in association with [Apocalyptic Art Collective](apocalypticartcollective.com), a community of artists committed to the mutual support of tent-maker artists who, through their work, make the case that there's more to this world than meets the eye.
