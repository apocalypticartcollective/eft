*Echo Future Truth: A Creation Story in Three Parts*

&nbsp;

If you're the kind of person that believes in a creator, then you may also believe that we are created to be *creative*. Made to make stuff, built to build, etc., and that this gift of creativity is meant to redound to the generosity of the one who made us. And yet, let's be honest: while we are spectacularly creative creatures, often our creations have more to say about our small fears, lusts, and greed than offering any good word about the meaning of life. *Echo Future Truth* considers the question of meaning from the perspective of a single, final, monumental creative work of humankind, designed to serve the last human being, whose own creative power will have to be unleashed for any of it to matter in the end.

*Echo Future Truth* is the first novel written by **D.P. Maddalena**, though he has written commercially and creatively for decades. He has traveled widely, studying and working in Cambridge and London, UK; Athens, Greece; New York City; Vermont, Pasadena and Los Angeles; and Silicon Valley, California, U.S.A.; and held alternating roles as educator, senior writer in the tech industry, community organizer, pastor, and, today, as a licensed psychotherapist. Along the way, he's self-published two nonfiction collections of essays; published poetry, essays, and collage in online and print magazines; and participated in local theater, music, and spoken-word performance art scenes. His fiction is shaped by decades under the influence of scripture and scholarship, poetry and theater, world culture and religion, modern psychology and spirituality, and, above all, people in their own magnificent stories.
