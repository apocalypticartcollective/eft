*Echo Future Truth: A Creation Story in Three Parts*

&nbsp;


*Echo Future Truth* is the first novel written by **D.P. Maddalena**, though he has written commercially and creatively for decades. He has traveled widely, studying and working in Cambridge and London, UK; Athens, Greece; New York City, New York; Vermont, Pasadena and Los Angeles; and Silicon Valley, California, U.S.A.; and held alternating roles as educator, senior writer in the tech industry, community organizer, pastor, and, today, as a licensed psychotherapist. Along the way, he's self-published two nonfiction collections of essays; published poetry, essays, and collage in online and print magazines; and participated in local theater, music, and spoken-word performance art scenes. His fiction is shaped by decades under the influence of scripture and scholarship, poetry and theater, world culture and religion, modern psychology and spirituality, and, above all, people in their own magnificent stories.




## Dedication

*To Harry Reynolds and his bastard file, now never dull*.

## Acknowledgements

The author wrote, edited, produced, engineered, and recorded the work presented herein, but would never have been able to do so without the support and care from all who are mentioned below. This work only exists because the author stood on the proverbial shoulders of giants (seriously, look at that list of people; if you know, you know). The author, having been so elevated, promptly lept off the shoulders of the giants, thinking he could fly; so, as the saying goes, *all credit for the good to thee, all blame for missing the mark to me*.
