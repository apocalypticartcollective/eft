title: About
---


Written over seven years beginning in 2015, *Echo Future Truth* is D.P. Maddalena's first novel. Publishers like to hear what popular books your book is like when you're shopping your story around. For better or worse, this story was not written to a formula; my fiction is shaped by decades under the influence of scripture and scholarship, poetry and theater, world culture and religion, modern psychology and spirituality, and, above all, people in their own magnificent stories. I've traveled the world, studying and working in Cambridge and London, UK; Athens, Greece; New York City; and Pasadena, Los Angeles, and Silicon Valley, California. I've written commercially and creatively for decades while employed in a variety of roles: educator, writer in the tech industry (from freelance to senior roles), marketing director for a design firm, pastor and community organizer, retail sales at REI (Store of the Year, 1994! Still kind of a dream job, if I'm honest). Today I'm a licensed psychotherapist in California. Over the years, I've self-published two nonfiction collections of essays, and my poetry, essays, and collage art have been published in online and print magazines. I hold an MDiv from Fuller Seminary ('93) and an MA from Santa Clara University (2016). As a student at Bennington College in the 80s, I studied theater, sculpture, painting, and writing (with a little dance thrown in for good measure). Rounding out the art-school bona fides, I've spent my life eagerly pursuing opportunities to participate in local theater, art, music, and spoken-word performance art scenes. 


## Dedication

*To Harry Reynolds and his bastard file, now never dull*.

## Acknowledgements

The author wrote, edited, produced, engineered, and recorded the work presented herein, but would never have been able to do so without the support and critical guidance from all who are mentioned below. This work only exists because the author stood on the proverbial shoulders of giants (seriously, look at that list of people; if you know, you know). Also, the author, having been so elevated, promptly lept off the shoulders of the giants, thinking he could fly; so, as the saying goes, *all credit for the good to thee, all blame for missing the mark to me*.
