*Echo Future Truth* is a three-part novel exploring isolation and psycho-spiritual resilience at the imagined end of human history. In Book One, *Abrasion*, a single woman, the last human being, faces off against a confounding culture of comforting machines millennia from now, desperately pursuing any remnant of authentic connection that might have survived in the system that defines her life. Book Two, *Isolation*, is set in our present time and follows an old ally of the protagonist of *Abrasion*, but separated from her by thousands of miles and, finally, thousands of years; he also is isolated from the rest of humanity and must battle his way back, only in his case the exile is self-imposed and the obstacles are of his own making. In the final act, *Resistance*, we follow the present-day technologists who scramble to understand (and encode) human need and human provision before abandoning the last human being to her fate. 

Echo Future Truth is many things: a sometimes pre-, sometimes post-modern exploration of a very modern problem; a reluctant and unsexy cyberpunk epic; an intentionally mythopoetic love story; and, (let the reader understand) an apocalyptic A.I. salvation story at the end — and maybe also the beginning — of the world.

These pages will be hosting a serialized audio presentation that begins December 2025.

About the author: **D.P. Maddalena** has traveled widely, studying and working in Cambridge and London, UK; Athens, Greece; New York City; Los Angeles; and Silicon Valley; and held alternating roles as educator, senior writer in the tech industry, community organizer, pastor, and, today, as a licensed psychotherapist.
