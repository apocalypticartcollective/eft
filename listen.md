# Where to Listen


You can read each chapter as it becomes available here on this site or on Substack, where the audio will also be hosted. But you may choose where to listen. Echo Future Truth audio will be released episod by episode on a weekly basis starting late 2025. Listen on Substack or via your favorite podcast player. 

If you prefer a good binge to weekly short episodes, note: the novel contains three separate-but-connected stories, *Abrasion*, *Isolation*, and *Resistance*. Episodes from these individual stories will each fill about a couple months, so you can mark your calendar, hit up one of the sources listed below and go nuts. 

## Substack for email delivery and to listen

Visit [echofuturetruth.substack.com](https://echofuturetruth.substack.com) to listen and/or subscribe to email releases. Note that on the welcome page you will have the opportunity to share your email address to receive weekly emails (and *maybe* the odd announcement about this project only). But you can also click past that screen (the 'I'll listen here' link below the form) to drop right into the page with the latest episodes, no subscription needed.
