## Where to Listen (and read)

**Echo Future Truth** is released for free as a weekly serial. You can read and listen to each chapter as it becomes available right here on this site. If you prefer a good binge to weekly short episodes, simply mark your calendar and hit up one of the sources listed below to listen all at once. The novel has three parts -- Abrasion, Isolation, and Resistance -- each of which is less than ten chapters, so if you tune in once every couple months, you will be able to listen to one complete section at a time. **Options for subscriptions, email delivery, and podcasting below.**

*If you listen to a lot of podcasts, you may prefer to listen to talk-shows at a faster-than-normal speed. This work of fiction has relatively short chapters and, in the author's humble opinion, is best listened to at 1x speed. The reading is part of the art, after all. If you've got places to be, and* must *listen at a faster speed, please at least disable any AI feature that removes quiet spaces from the reading. Silence is also part of the art, and you are not running out of time.*
