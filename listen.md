## Where to Listen (and read)

**Echo Future Truth** is released for free as a weekly serial. You can read and listen to each chapter as it becomes available right here on this site. If you prefer a good binge to weekly short episodes, simply mark your calendar and hit up one of the sources listed below to listen all at once. The novel has three parts -- Abrasion, Isolation, and Resistance -- each of which is less than ten chapters, so if you tune in once every couple months, you will be able to listen to one complete section at a time. **Options for subscriptions, email delivery, and podcasting below.**

*If you listen to a lot of podcasts, you may prefer to listen to talk-shows at a faster-than-normal speed. This work of fiction has relatively short chapters and, in the author's humble opinion, is best listened to at 1x speed. The reading is part of the art, after all. If you've got places to be, and* must *listen at a faster speed, please at least disable any AI feature that removes quiet spaces from the reading. Silence is also part of the art, and you are not running out of time.*

## Playlists

In stories, we're careful not to assign too much meaning to a given moment, but patiently allow all moments to work together toward an understanding of the whole. These playlists can be thought of in the same way. Each one of these songs is a moment that plucked a string inside the author while he was deep in the telling of these stories. No single one of them can be said to tell the whole story, or even tell the *same* story as my story. But if you listen along, you might catch a feeling that I felt along the way. Think of these more like audio *mood boards*, less like the soundtrack to the Netflix adaption (which doesn't exist. Yet. Hey Netflix, let's talk.)

Sample songs below or click through to your player of choice (if you do not have a subscription on either Apple Music or Spotify, the latter has a free subscription tier where you can listen to the entire playlist). Note: the algorithms will autoplay 'suggested songs' after the playlist is finished; maybe you'll get lucky, but when the robots take over, you are outside my jurisdiction.
