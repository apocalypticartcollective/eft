title: Support the Artist
---

*Echo Future Truth* is released free for you to enjoy and to freely share. This series of audio recordings is a labor of love: receive the love (and, if you're able, show some love for the laborer)! 

If you're listening along and thinking to yourself, "That's worth a triple-seasonal-spice-coffeebomination-and-a-ham-and-cheese-croissant", consider supporting the author via the link below. The work will remain free and you will be able to read and listen whether or not you're able to make a financial contribution. Glad to have you along.
