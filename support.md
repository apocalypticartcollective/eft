*Echo Future Truth* is available free for you to enjoy and to freely share. This serialized presentation is a labor of love: please receive it in that spirit! And, if you are so moved, hit the button below to show some love for the laborer.

That is, if you're listening along and thinking to yourself, "That's worth a triple-seasonal-spice-coffeebomination-and-a-blueberry-scone", consider supporting the author via the link below. The work will remain free indefinitely to read and listen to, whether or not you're able to make a financial contribution. Glad to have you along.
